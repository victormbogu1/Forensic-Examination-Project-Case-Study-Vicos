Conclusion 

Knowing the Value of Digital Evidence is vital to organizations. An In-depth Guide to Appropriate Evidence Handling in Mickins will hasten the investigation. The primary objective of this document is to underscore the crucial value of digital evidence and shed light on the prevalent oversight observed in numerous organizations. Often, available evidence proves inadequate or needs more appropriate handling protocols when it becomes necessary to establish the veracity of charges related to fraudulent transactions or malicious activities. By offering a comprehensive manual on proper evidence handling within Mickins Company, this paper aims to streamline the process of prosecuting attackers, ultimately facilitating law enforcement agencies in achieving favorable outcomes. 

1.4. A) Case Background 

Mickins construction firm manager John Prone has been tasked with managing the impending election among the 120 branches, including UK branches, to determine who would be the next chairman of the board of directors of Mickins construction company. The board of directors chose John for this critical position. The introduction of the Bimodal Voters Authentication System (BVAS), a computerized voting method, was advocated to improve transparency and efficiency. 

However, numerous stakeholders and electoral commissions expressed concerns about purported election-related violations, notably concerning the electronic transmission of election results. Because of the issues, the presumed winner filed a lawsuit against John, who oversaw the election's behavior.  

After a few court proceedings, access was granted to investigate the Bimodal Voters Authentication System (BVAS). There was clear evidence that the director manipulated and deleted the results of the presumed winner, and this was because he succumbed to being influenced by contesting oppositions by accepting bribes, compromising the integrity of the electoral process, and potentially jeopardizing the Mickins construction company's future. The election computer has been submitted to digital forensic examination to obtain evidence that can either incriminate or exonerate manager John Prone and his accomplices.

1.5. B) Tools and techniques used to commit and investigate the Cyber-Crimes 

The forensic tool used in investigating the suspect fraudulent act was Access Data Forensic Toolkit (FTK) Imager 4.7.1 Version. This FTK imager was used to create a disk image, conduct analysis, and recover files of the disk image from the suspect drive. A sound forensic practice is to acquire copies (prints) of the affected systemâ€™s data and operate on those copies to aid in this process. Further, the FTK tool calculates MD5 and SHA1 hash values and can verify that the integrity of the data image is consistent with the created forensic image. Access Data Forensic Toolkit is a standalone disk imaging software known as FTK Imager, one of the most admired software suites available to digital forensic professionals (Holt et al., 2022). 

1.6. c) Creating digital evidence forensics 

Some procedures and goals must be met for this investigation to successfully pursue the culprit. Based on this case study, the use of an external USB drive from the suspect, including a Virtual machine, to carry out this investigation. 
The methods and tools for creating, analyzing, and retrieving files from a disk image of the suspect drive are listed below (Chandel, 2020).
